        PRIVACY POLICY
      </div>

      <h1>FindMe! Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="tagline">
        This Privacy Policy explains how FindMe! collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the app.
      </p>
      <p class="effective">
        Effective date: 08 February 2026
      </p>

      <hr class="section-divider" />

      <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        FindMe! is a mobile application that helps users discover nearby people and view the social media profiles they choose to share. This Privacy Policy applies only to the FindMe! app.
      </p>

      <h2>2. What data we collect</h2>
      <p>
        FindMe! is designed to collect only the minimum amount of information needed to provide the core functionality of the app.
      </p>

      <h3>2.1. Account data</h3>
      <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Email address (used for login, account security, and password reset)</li>
        <li>Username</li>
        <li>Authentication data provided by our identity provider (Firebase Authentication)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2. Profile data</h3>
      <p>Within your profile, you can optionally add:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Profile photo (optional)</li>
        <li>Profile rows (for example: apps, services, or other information you choose to show)</li>
        <li>Comment / bio text you enter yourself</li>
        <li>
          Social media usernames or links (such as Instagram or other platforms).
          This information is provided entirely by you and is only displayed to other users
          for profile discovery purposes. We do not access, verify, or interact with your
          social media accounts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All profile content is provided voluntarily by you and is visible to other users according to the app’s design.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3. Location data</h3>
      <p>
        To show you nearby users, FindMe! uses your device’s location (with your permission). Depending on your settings, we may collect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Approximate GPS coordinates (latitude &amp; longitude)</li>
        <li>A derived GeoHash or similar approximate location representation</li>
        <li>Timestamps such as <span class="strong">lastUpdated</span> and <span class="strong">lastAppclose</span> to reflect your recent activity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Location data is used only to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calculate distance between you and other users</li>
        <li>Determine whether other users are “nearby” according to the app’s logic</li>
        <li>Update your presence so that outdated or inactive users are not shown</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.4. Usage &amp; device data</h3>
      <p>
        For security, reliability, and notifications, we may also collect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A device or push notification identifier (for example, an FCM token) to send notifications to your device</li>
        <li>Basic technical information such as app version, language, and platform (iOS)</li>
        <li>Crash or error logs provided by our service providers</li>
      </ul>

      <hr class="section-divider" />

      <h2>3. How we use your data</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To create and manage your account and allow you to sign in securely</li>
        <li>To display your profile (username, photo, profile rows, comment, and social links you choose) to other users</li>
        <li>To show you nearby users based on location data and activity timestamps</li>
        <li>To send push notifications when relevant (for example, when users are nearby according to the app’s rules)</li>
        <li>To maintain the security, stability, and performance of the app</li>
        <li>To prevent misuse (for example, spam or abuse)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Users can disable their visibility at any time from the app settings.
        When visibility is turned off, location data is not used to display the user to others.
      </p>

      <hr class="section-divider" />

      <h2>4. Legal basis (for users in the EU/EEA)</h2>
      <p>
        If you are located in the European Union or European Economic Area, we process your personal data based on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="strong">Contract necessity</span> – to provide the core functionality of the app (account, profile, nearby users).</li>
        <li><span class="strong">Legitimate interests</span> – to keep the service secure, prevent abuse, and improve reliability.</li>
        <li><span class="strong">Consent</span> – for access to location services and push notifications, which you can allow or deny in your device settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr class="section-divider" />

      <h2>5. How we share your data</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. We share data only with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="strong">Service providers</span> who help us operate the app, such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Firebase Authentication (for login and account management)</li>
            <li>Firebase Firestore (for storing user and profile data)</li>
            <li>Firebase Storage (for storing profile images)</li>
            <li>Firebase Cloud Messaging (for push notifications)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="strong">Other users</span> – only to the extent necessary for the app to work (for example, showing your username, profile image, profile rows, comment, and social media handles you choose to add).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Service providers act as data processors on our behalf and are not allowed to use your data for their own marketing.
      </p>

      <hr class="section-divider" />

      <h2>6. Data storage &amp; retention</h2>
      <p>
        Your data is stored in cloud infrastructure operated by our service providers (for example, Firebase/Google Cloud).
      </p>
      <p>
        We keep your account and profile data for as long as your account remains active. Location and presence data (such as recent coordinates and timestamps) may be kept for a limited period to ensure that nearby user results are reasonably up to date.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you log out and stop using the app, some technical or backup copies may remain for a limited time in system logs or backups, but they are removed or anonymized when no longer needed.
      </p>

      <hr class="section-divider" />

      <h2>7. Your choices &amp; controls</h2>
      <h3>7.1. Location permissions</h3>
      <p>
        You can control location access at any time from your device settings. If you revoke location permission, the app will not be able to show nearby users based on your location.
      </p>

      <h3>7.2. Visibility &amp; active status</h3>
      <p>
        Within the app, you can change your visibility status (for example, Active/Inactive) from the settings screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you disable your visibility, your location data is not used to display you to other users in nearby results. You may also see fewer or no location-based interactions while invisible.
      </p>

      <h3>7.3. Notifications</h3>
      <p>
        You can allow or deny push notifications in your device settings. If you disable notifications, we will not send push alerts to your device.
      </p>

      <h3>7.4. Profile content</h3>
      <p>
        You can edit or remove your profile information (photo, profile rows, comment, and social media links) from within the app. Certain core account data such as your email address may be required for login and cannot be removed without deleting your account.
      </p>

      <h3>7.5. Stopping use of the app</h3>
      <p>
        You can stop using FindMe! at any time by logging out and uninstalling the app. You can also revoke permissions (such as location or notifications) from your device settings.
      </p>

      <hr class="section-divider" />

      <h2>8. Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        FindMe! is not intended for children under the age required by local law (for example, 13 or 16 years old). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children in this age range. If we learn that such data has been collected, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.
      </p>

      <hr class="section-divider" />

      <h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Effective date” at the top of this page. Your continued use of the app after an update means that you accept the revised Policy.
